# day2demo
 
This repository is created for giving Demo on Git & Github.

things  I did for making this repository.

+ Created a empty repository named `day2demo` in [GitHub] (https://github.com/new) .
+ Copied the contents from the page titled `create a new repository on the command line` and the 
lines are
```
echo "day2demo" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Vaniarumugam17/day2demo.git
git push -u origin main
```
+ I have created an empty folder in my file explorer and opened the folder in CMD. After Opened CMD
I just copy pasted executed the lines one by one.
+ This first line `echo "git-and-github" >> READMe.md" created an READMe.md File with the content  `# git-and-github` .
